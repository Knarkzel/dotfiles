- Model submission files after [example.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking/master/example.md). Put them in src/.
=> Use this emoji-variant:

```
- ⏲️ Prep time: 10 min
- 🍳Cook time: 30 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 4
```

- Recipes should start with a title, with a single #, on the first line. No empty line at the top, not trailing line at the end. The file needs to be \n terminated in linux-fashion (if you're on linux you don't need to care, it should be automatic).
=> $1

- File names should be the name of the dish with words separated by hyphens (-). Not underscores, and definitely not spaces.
=> $2

- Recipe must be based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food. Nothing ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.
=> $3

- Don't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients list.
=> $4
